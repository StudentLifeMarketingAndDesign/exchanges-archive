        <h1><a href="/exchanges-archive/issues/hackwork/contributors-3/oana-sanziana-marian/">Oana Sanziana Marian</a></h1>
<p><br>He had decided all of a sudden to become a vegetarian. Joan was a vegetarian and, whenever they ate together, he felt light and special. He'd seen a film that Rares recommended, about the slaughter industry, a little didactic, but in a way, not didactic enough. His grandfather, the butcher, had often taken him to work with him, and he'd seen all there was to see. But if the images of calves shut for months in suffocating enclosures, without air or light, and raised on bad feed with no iron, only to be butchered, didn't strike the younger Dan as disturbing, it was that they were part and parcel of the familiar philosophy: life is hard, boy. But this was Dan the 30-year old mammal, who had come this close to being consumed from the inside by his own enzymes, who cheated death not least of which because he had too little fat inside of him, fat along which the lipases would have traveled, and these images seriously shook him. Pigs tearing one another's live flesh with the indifference of the abattoirs themselves (normal in their case, as a defensive mechanism), made him wonder if the way he'd made Viviana suffer wasn't exactly the same thing. The man in overalls cutting the beasts' teeth with no anesthetic seemed less sinister than the man who had decided, in an afternoon (not even he knew exactly when or if he really decided something or if a thought had just come and settled on the surface, above other thoughts and for a little bit longer) to flay the living symbiotic animal that had barely begun to stand after three years and some months. There was nothing metaphoric in this; suffering is suffering all around, he knew from the hospital, and the lessons of the abattoir had taken effect. Just like his grandfather, he could deliberately inflict torture and be empathetic at the same time, suffering alongside the tortured. He didn't even know why he'd done it; he had no solid reason that he could have used in court or in an official action, something clear and devoid of auto-justifying subtleties. The simplest answer would have been that he'd fallen in love with Joan, but not even he was convinced that that was the real answer. Maybe he did it to prove that he was fit to do it, and to reconstruct himself, priding himself that he'd become a panzer of will and control. He passed carelessly past the alcohol aisle of the supermarket; he no longer even saw it. Past the packs of cigarettes, without which, previously, he couldn't even imagine his waking. But would he have been able to arrive there without her? Would he ever have gotten his teeth fixed if she hadn't been there, forever phoning, forever in love, without pause, before and after every dentist appointment? She had helped him create an entirely new life for himself, and he'd thrown her out of it. <br><br>And still, he'd planned it all out somehow; they were tied together, the meat, his renunciation of meat, and of her, his renunciation of her fabulous materiality, which he had received so hungrily before. There'd been a switch; he could swear he'd heard it. <br><br>It happened on one of those June nights during which, long ago, Duke Karl Eugen's retainers would have been pushing giant boulders of salt up the hill, spreading the salt around so that the Duke and his paramours could sled into the valley to Leonberg. The light surrounding the castle was the kind that empties you of desire, and Dan was lying on the grass, reading, alongside the football field where he'd first seen Joan running after the ball. Noticing his gaze, Viviana had said, <br><br>"Why don't you go and play, too... tackle the Chinese girl."<br><br>But Joan had thought that the two of them were a couple of junkies from nearby, "I didn't imagine that you could have been residents," judging by their colorful clothes and his manner of sitting with his spine bent "towards the center of the world," as someone once told him.Â  Until one day, Ian taught him to hold himself straight, and since then, he'dÂ  tried to hold himself straight:<br><br>"Imagine that the top of your head is being pulled up by a wire. You don't need to do it all the time but at least while you are waiting in the bus station. We should train our balance a little, at least while we're young."</p>
<p>And now Joan and Ian were coming out of the woods on a Staiger, he, pedaling gently so as not to shake her and she, in the back, holding him by his waist, laughing lightly at one of their secret jokes, which you could never hear, but which left you with the impression that they came one after another, every moment. Ian was a very handsome man, a tall and lean Scotsman with blue, intelligent eyes that were never aggressive. The kind of man on which you could depend at any and all times, the kind that Dan feared he would not be able to be anytime soon. Later, when it was all over, Dan asked himself if they had actually opened their mouths and spoken or if they'd just heard each others' thoughts, carried waves of light, from one to the other.<br><br>"Hey, you took my bicycle."<br><br>"It doesn't say anywhere that it's yours."<br><br>"It doesn't say, but it's mine."<br><br>"How are you?"<br><br>"Fine. We were in the woods. How are you?"<br><br>"Reading."<br><br>"Where is Viviana?"<br><br>"In Stuttgart, at the sauna, with Medeine and Jonathan." <br><br>"When Ian leaves, who will I jump and whose ears am I going to pull, like... this!"<br><br>"Ow!"<br><br>"Crybaby. Dan, will you let me jump you?"<br><br>"Anytime, Joan. You can even hit me."<br><br>"I don't have the courage anymore; I heard that Ian gave you capoeira lessons."<br><br>"Yeah, I'm already a white belt."<br><br>"We don't have belts in capoeira."<br><br>"Hey, you never told me that. You tricked me. What point is there in learning a martial art if I don't get a belt?"<br><br>"No one is stopping you from wearing a belt. Did you eat dinner?"<br><br>"No, you want to eat?"<br><br>"Yeah, come over to our place."</p>
<p>For a moment that same strange place seemed just as familiar as the little orchard in front of his grandparents' house, which appeared sometimes in his dreams. It happened again once when he discovered, while perched on a downed road sign smoking a joint with Joan, that she and his brother have a mutual friend, a Portuguese theater critic. It was nothing extraordinary; Nutzu had started to travel more around Europe, to attend festivals. But this name, Tiago, spoken by them, made him happy because, look, once again, the world has proven itself their playing field.<br><br>Tofu and red cabbage â€“ to Dan this seemed like such a good thing. Viviana had returned from the sauna; she was hot and smelled of lemons. She wore her grey dress that revealed large portions of bronzed skin. She was pleased with how the day had passed, and sleepy, and Dan was thinking that it was in fact a crude law that kept him from touching her at every moment, anywhere, in any way, as she would have liked. They sat on the couch and watched a Chinese film on the projector. Viviana fell asleep instantly in front of him, in the armchair. Dan was next to Joan on the couch and could barely keep his eyes open. Yes, she could even transmit to him her somnolence, the way his mother used to in the afternoons, when she wanted to rest for a few hours. She would pull the curtains, stretch out on her bed, close her eyes, and, just like that, Dutzu would become sleepy. <br><br>Thatâ€™s when the switch flipped in his head.Â  <br><br>He would have liked to wake her and say, â€œHey, get up, youâ€™re missing your last chance to sleep with Ian, and everyone. Câ€™mon, Ian leaves tomorrow, for good. Weâ€™re all here, ready for an orgy. Isnâ€™t that what you wanted? Isnâ€™t that what Freud wants from all of us?<br><br>He felt that he loved her so much, he would have liked to invent the most idiotic diminutives to express it, so that she would understand. Squeals and gurgles. To drool and snot on her, to rub up against her thighs. He wanted this continuously and all the time; her body asked for it. And he needed to stop it; it was too much. Too much matter degrading into a medium that would make way for the killer enzymes, too much pussy and tits and ass and guts. All that eating became shit and shit stays in the guts for a week and then another week. And doctors pass by your bed in the morning and shake their fingers at you, â€œYoung man, if you donâ€™t get your bowels moving soon, youâ€™ll die. We farted today, no? We need to fart. If you donâ€™t fart, you die.â€ And all day long you think about how to do it, how to fart so that you wonâ€™t disappoint the doctor and so that you donâ€™t die. But what can you do? How can you control your sleepy intestines? They sleep like snakes in the daytime. Youâ€™ve seen them at the reptile exhibit, in their aquariums, sleeping all over each other. They donâ€™t move, and you wasted your money. And you feel so guilty for your greed and impatience, your ill-will, which, here you go, has accumulated inside of you and is rotting, and pretty soon will poison you. A woman tells you, â€œLift your legs and spread them.â€ She sticks a hose in you and pumps water. And the woman who loves you stands by, mad with fear, encouraging you to expel the dried up waste; she holds your hand and what can you do, you have to do it there in front of twenty men and their wives and their daughters and nieces. But you canâ€™t. And thank God that the other woman of your life isnâ€™t here, too, to drive you crazy, as well, to meddle and poke her nose into everything and chew everyoneâ€™s ears off without making any sense, asking stupid questions and adjusting your pajama collar, â€œOof, my boy, you canâ€™t even take a proper shit,â€ and still youâ€™d be the one embarrassed for her, the simple peasant woman who raised you and your brother all by herself, deprecating herself and coddling these beasts of men, confused, unprepared, dirt-poor, cleaning up so much of your shit, and paying off the idiot doctors and their idiot nurses, so they can buy themselves more crap, the same doctors and nurses who cast you looks that say, â€œGet your stupid mother out of here.â€ Oh, good thing you didnâ€™t let her come, not that she would have insisted too much on coming, not that she would have understood what was actually happening. But do you understand what is happening? What have you understood, itâ€™s only you and the woman who loves you, who sees you in this sorry state and utterly diminishes you, because although you asked her a thousand times, the dumb cunt didn't go home, she wants to sleep next to you, to be a martyr, to make the grade, like all the women in your family, and her stupid mother says to her, "Darling, don't spend too much money, what's the use if he's not going to make it..." but, hey, the guts are starting up now, du-du-dum and social life resumes, fashionable parties and chic people, interesting and well-made men, flirting and sex-sex-sex, and alcohol and ambitions, interviews, nice clothes, glossy magazines, and you like it, you feel cocky next to her, even though you're scared all the time you might not rise to the occasion, even though you'd like to hide somewhere, to be left alone with your stupid thoughts, clotted in shit, to take yourself in your own arms and cry without stopping, little shitty pants that you are.Â Â Â  <br><br>Later, he became a vegetarian, but on the day that, after pedaling for a few hours, he returned to the studio and said that he'd like for them to stay together and break up at the same time, she had cooked some turkey cutlets, yellow and sodden with condiments, and he liked them. It wasn't at all what he was used to, how it happens in the movies. At least, it wasn't how things went for him; the break upÂ  didn't make him lose his appetite. He would have liked to drink a tall glass of white wine, or maybe eleven beers. <br><br>And after a few hours, he was telling Joan on the steps, "How weird, I've never been awake when breaking up with someone."<br><br>And she laughed and caressed his spine.</p>

<p><br>Se hotÄƒrÃ®se deodatÄƒ sÄƒ devinÄƒ vegetarian. Joan era vegetarianÄƒ ÅŸi, de cÃ®te ori mÃ®ncau Ã®mpreunÄƒ, se simÅ£ea uÅŸor ÅŸi special. VÄƒzuse un film pe care i-l recomandase RareÅŸ despre industria abatoarelor, puÅ£in cam didactic, dar, Ã®ntr-un fel, nu destul de didactic. Bunicul sÄƒu, mÄƒcelarul, Ã®l luase de multe ori cu el Ia muncÄƒ, le vÄƒzuse pe toate. Dar, dacÄƒ atunci imaginea viÅ£eilor Ã®nchiÅŸi cÃ®teva luni Ã®n locuri sufocante, fÄƒrÄƒ aer ÅŸi luminÄƒ ÅŸi hrÄƒniÅ£i cu mÃ®ncare proastÄƒ, lipsitÄƒ de fier, pentru ca apoi sÄƒ fie omorÃ®Å£i, nu erau pentru DuÅ£u deloc tulburÄƒtoare, fÄƒceauÂ  parte din aceeaÅŸi filozofie, viaÅ£a e grea bÄƒiete, pe Dan, mamiferul de 30 de ani, care fusese cÃ®t pe ce sÄƒ fie mÃ®ncat pe dinÄƒuntru de enzime, dar scÄƒpase ÅŸi pentru cÄƒ avea prea puÅ£inÄƒ grÄƒsime Ã®n el, prin care lipazele sÄƒ-ÅŸi facÄƒ drum, Ã®l zguduiau acum serios. Porcii rupÃ®nd unul din carnea vie a celuilalt, ca ÅŸi indiferenÅ£a mÄƒcelarilor, normalÄƒ, Ã®n cazul lor, ca mecanism de protecÅ£ie, Ã®l fÄƒceau sÄƒ se Ã®ntrebe dacÄƒ felul Ã®n care o fÄƒcuse pe Viviana sÄƒ sufere nu era exact acelaÅŸi lucru. BÄƒrbatul Ã®n salopetÄƒ tÄƒindu-le zilnic dinÅ£ii animalelor fÄƒrÄƒ anestezie pÄƒrea mult mai puÅ£in sinistru decÃ®t bÄƒrbatul care hotÄƒrÃ®se Ã®ntr-o dupÄƒ-amiazÄƒ, nici el nu ÅŸtia exact cÃ®nd ÅŸi dacÄƒ hotÄƒrÃ®se ceva cu adevÄƒrat sau doar Ã®i venise un gÃ®nd, unul care s-a menÅ£inut deasupra mai multe ore decÃ®t celelalte, sÄƒ jupoaie de viu animalul simbiotic abia ridicat pe picioare, Ã®n doar trei ani ÅŸi cÃ®teva luni. Nu era nimic metaforic aici: suferinÅ£a e suferinÅ£Äƒ peste tot, o ÅŸtia din spital, iar educaÅ£ia din abator Ã®ÅŸi fÄƒcuse efectul. La fel ca bunicul lui, putea sÄƒ provoace deliberat chinul, fiind Ã®n acelaÅŸi timp empatic, suferind alÄƒturi de vietatea chinuitÄƒ. Nici nu ÅŸtia de ce o fÄƒcuse, nu avea nici un motiv solid pe care l-ar fi putut folosi Ã®ntr-un tribunal, Ã®ntr-un act oficial - unul dar ÅŸi, pe scurt, fÄƒrÄƒ subtilitÄƒÅ£i autojustificatoare. Cel mai simplu rÄƒspuns ar fi fost cÄƒ se Ã®ndrÄƒgostise de Joan, dar nu era nici el convins cÄƒ e rÄƒspunsul adevÄƒrat. Poate o fÄƒcuse ca sÄƒ arate cÄƒ e Ã®n stare de asta, sÄƒ se reconstruiascÄƒ. PurtÃ®nd Ã®n el, Ã®n adÃ®nc, mÃ®ndria cÄƒ a devenit un Panzer de voinÅ£Äƒ ÅŸi control. Trecea nepÄƒsÄƒtor prin supermarket pe lÃ®ngÄƒ rafturile cu alcool, nici nu le mai vedea. Pe lÃ®ngÄƒ pachetele de Å£igÄƒri de la intrare, fÄƒrÄƒ de care pe vremuri nici nu -ÅŸi imagina trezirea din somn. Dar oare ar fi putut ajunge acolo fÄƒrÄƒ ea? Åži-ar mai fi pus vreodatÄƒ dinÅ£ii dacÄƒ nu ar fi fost ea ÅŸi telefoanele ei Ã®ndrÄƒgostite, Ã®ntotdeauna Ã®ndrÄƒgostite, fÄƒrÄƒ pauzÄƒ, de dinainte ÅŸi de dupÄƒ fiecare ÅŸedinÅ£Äƒ la stomatolog? Ea Ã®l ajutase sÄƒ-ÅŸi creeze o viaÅ£Äƒ cu totul nouÄƒ, iar el o dÄƒduse afarÄƒ din viaÅ£a cea nouÄƒ.<br><br>Åži totuÅŸi, le plÄƒnuise cumva, erau legate Ã®ntre ele: carnea, renunÅ£area la carne ÅŸi ea, renunÅ£area la materialitatea ei fabuloasÄƒ, pe care o primise cu atÃ®ta poftÄƒ pe vremuri. Fusese un dedic, aproape cÄƒ Ã®l auzise Ã®n urechi.<br><br>Se Ã®ntÃ®mplase Ã®ntr-una din serile acelea de varÄƒ Ã®n care, pe vremuri, Ã®n astfel de seri de iunie, oamenii ducelui Eugen urcau pe deal bolovani uriaÅŸi de sare, pe care o Ã®mprÄƒÅŸtiau pentru ca acesta ÅŸi amantele lui sÄƒ se dea cu sania la vale, pÃ®nÄƒ Ã®n Leonberg. Lumina din jurul castelului era din acel soi care te goleÅŸte de dorinÅ£e ÅŸi Dan citea Ã®ntins pe iarbÄƒ, lÃ®ngÄƒ terenul de fotbal, unde o vÄƒzuse pe Joan prima oarÄƒ alergÃ®nd dupÄƒ minge. Viviana Ã®i spusese atunci, observÃ®ndu-i privirea:<br><br>- Du-te ÅŸi tu ÅŸi te joacÄƒ, atinge-te cu chinezoaica.<br><br>Iar Joan crezuse cÄƒ ei doi sÃ®nt un cuplu de junkies de prin apropiere, "nu mÄƒ gÃ®ndeam cÄƒ aÅ£i putea fi rezidenÅ£i", dupÄƒ hainele ei colorate ÅŸi felul lui de a sta, cu spinarea Ã®ndoitÄƒ, ducÃ®ndu-se spre centrul pÄƒmÃ®ntului, cum Ã®i zisese cineva. PÃ®nÄƒ cÃ®nd, altÄƒdatÄƒ, lan l-a Ã®nvÄƒÅ£at sÄƒ stea drept ÅŸi de atunci a Ã®ncercat sÄƒ se Å£inÄƒ aÅŸa:<br><br>-ImagineazÄƒ -Å£i cÄƒ vÃ®rful capului e tras Ã®n sus de un fir. Nu e nevoie sÄƒ o faci tot timpul, dar mÄƒcar cÃ®nd aÅŸtepÅ£i Ã®n staÅ£ia de autobuz. SÄƒ ne construim puÅ£in echilibru cÃ®t sÃ®ntem tineri.<br><br>Åži acum Joan ÅŸi lan ieÅŸeau din pÄƒdure pe Staiger, el pedalÃ®nd uÅŸor, ca sÄƒ n-o zgÃ®lÅ£Ã®ie, ÅŸi ea Ã®n spate, Å£inÃ®ndu-l de mijloc, rÃ®zÃ®nd delicat la una dintre glumele lor secrete, pe care nu le auzeai concret niciodatÄƒ, dar Ã®Å£i lÄƒsau impresia cÄƒ vin una dupÄƒ alta, Ã®n fiecare clipÄƒ. lan era un bÄƒrbat foarte frumos, un scoÅ£ian Ã®nalt ÅŸi subÅ£ire, cu ochi albaÅŸtri ÅŸi privirea inteligentÄƒ ÅŸi niciodatÄƒ agresivÄƒ. Genul de bÄƒrbat pe care te puteai baza oricÃ®nd, ceea ce Dan se temea cÄƒ n-o sÄƒ poatÄƒ fi prea curÃ®nd. Mai tÃ®rziu, dupÄƒ ce toate s-au terminat, Dan s-a Ã®ntrebat dacÄƒ au deschis atunci gurile sau doar ÅŸi-au auzit gÃ®ndurile duse de la unul la altul de luminÄƒ:<br><br>-Hei, mi-aÅ£i luat bicicleta.<br><br>-Nu scrie pe ea cÄƒ ar fi a ta.<br><br>-Nu scrie, dar e.<br><br>-Ce faceÅ£i?<br><br>-Bine, am fost Ã®n pÄƒdure, tu ce faci?<br><br>-Citesc.<br><br>-Unde e Viviana?<br><br>-E Ã®n Stuttgart, la saunÄƒ, cu Medeine ÅŸi Jonathan.<br><br>-CÃ®nd o sÄƒ plece lan, pe cine o sÄƒ mai sar sÄƒ-I trag de urechi, cum o sÄƒ fac . . . acum I<br><br>-Au.<br><br>-PlÃ®ngÄƒciosule. Dan, o sÄƒ mÄƒ laÅŸi sÄƒ sar pe tine?<br><br>-OricÃ®nd, Joan, poÅ£i sÄƒ mÄƒ ÅŸi baÅ£i.<br><br>-Nu mai am curaj, am auzit cÄƒ lan Å£i-a dat lecÅ£ii de capoeira.<br><br>-Da, am deja centura albÄƒ.<br><br>-Nu avem centuri Ã®n capoeira.<br><br>-Hei, nu mi-ai spus asta, mÄƒ simt pÄƒcÄƒlit.<br><br>Ce sens are sÄƒ Ã®nvÄƒÅ£ o artÄƒ marÅ£ialÄƒ dacÄƒ nu primesc centurÄƒ?<br><br>-Nimeni nu te opreÅŸte sÄƒ-Å£i pui una. Ai mÃ®ncat de searÄƒ?<br><br>-Nu, vreÅ£i sÄƒ mÃ®ncÄƒm?<br><br>-Da, hai la noi.<br><br>Tot acel loc strÄƒin i s-a pÄƒrut pentru o clipÄƒ la fel de familiar ca mica livadÄƒ din faÅ£a casei bunicilor, pe care o visa uneori. I se mai Ã®ntÃ®mplase cÃ®nd a descoperit cu Joan, Ã®n timp ce fumau un joint cÄƒÅ£ÄƒraÅ£i pe un stÃ®lp galben culcat la pÄƒmÃ®nt, cÄƒ ea ÅŸi fratele lui au un prieten comun, un critic de teatru portughez. Nu era ceva extraordinar, NuÅ£u Ã®ncepuse Ã®n ultima vreme sÄƒ meargÄƒ mult prin Europa, la festivaluri. Dar numele acestuia, Tiago, auzit de la ei, Ã®l fÄƒcea fericit, pentru cÄƒ, iatÄƒ, din nou, lumea se arÄƒta a fi terenul lor de joacÄƒ.<br><br>Tofu ÅŸi varzÄƒ roÅŸie - lui Dan i s-a pÄƒrut ceva atÃ®t de bun. Viviana venise ÅŸi ea de la saunÄƒ, era fierbinte ÅŸi mirosea a lÄƒmÃ®ie. Cu rochia ei gri, care Ã®i dezvÄƒluia porÅ£iuni mari de piele bronzatÄƒ, Ã®ncÃ®ntatÄƒ de ceea ce se petrecuse peste zi ÅŸi sonmoroasÄƒ, Dan se gÃ®ndea cÄƒ e de fapt o regulÄƒ crudÄƒ aceea care Ã®l Ã®mpiedica sÄƒ o atingÄƒ Ã®n fiecare clipÄƒ, oriunde, oricum, cum Ã®ÅŸi dorea. S-au aÅŸezat pe canapea ÅŸi au vÄƒzut la videoproiector, un film chinezesc. Viviana a adormit imediat Ã®n faÅ£a lui, pe fotoliu. Dan stÄƒtea lÃ®ngÄƒ Joan pe canapea ÅŸi abia Ã®ÅŸi putea Å£ine ochii deschiÅŸi. Da, putea sÄƒ facÄƒ ÅŸi asta, sÄƒ-i transmitÄƒ somnul ei, cum fÄƒcea mama lui dupÄƒ-amiaza, cÃ®nd voia liniÅŸte pentru cÃ®teva ore. Se Ã®ntindea pe pat, trÄƒgea perdelele, Ã®nchidea ochii ÅŸi, poc, lui DuÅ£u i se fÄƒcea somn.<br><br>Atunci a simÅ£it declicul Ã®n cap.<br><br>Ar fi vru t s-o trezeascÄƒ:<br><br>-Hei, scoalÄƒ-te, pierzi ocazia sÄƒ Å£i-o tragi cu lan, cu toatÄƒ lumea. Hai, cÄƒ mÃ®ine pleacÄƒ lan, de tot. SÃ®ntem toÅ£i aici, pregÄƒtiÅ£i de orgie. Nu asta voiai? Nu asta vrea ÅŸi Freud de la noi?<br><br><br>SimÅ£ea cÄƒ o iubeÅŸte aÅŸa de mult, ar fi vrut sÄƒ inventeze diminutive cÃ®t mai idioate ca sÄƒ exprime asta, ca ea sÄƒ Ã®nÅ£eleagÄƒ. Nu versuri, nu cuvinte. Å¢ipete, gÃ®ngureli. SÄƒ-ÅŸi lase balele pe ea, mucii, sÄƒ se frece de pulpele ei. Voia tot timpul, trupul ei Ã®i cerea asta. Åži trebuia sÄƒ-I opreascÄƒ, era prea mult. Prea multÄƒ materie care se degradeazÄƒ, mediu Ã®n care sÄƒ se miÅŸte enzimele ucigaÅŸe, prea multÄƒ pizdÄƒ ÅŸi Å£Ã®Å£e ÅŸi cur ÅŸi maÅ£e. ToatÄƒ mÃ®ncarea aia se fÄƒcea cÄƒcat ÅŸi cÄƒcatul rÄƒmÃ®ne Ã®n maÅ£e o sÄƒptÄƒmÃ®nÄƒ, apoi Ã®ncÄƒ una. Åži doctorii trec pe lÃ®ngÄƒ patul tÄƒu dimineaÅ£a ÅŸi te ameninÅ£Äƒ: bÄƒiete, dacÄƒ nu Ã®Å£i porneÅŸti maÅ£ ele cÃ®t de curÃ®nd, o sÄƒ mori. Ne-am beÅŸit azi? Nu? Trebuie sÄƒ ne beÅŸim. DacÄƒ nu te beÅŸeÅŸti, mori. Åži toatÄƒ ziua te gÃ®ndeÅŸti cum sÄƒ faci, sÄƒ te beÅŸeÅŸti, sÄƒ nu-l superi pe doctor ÅŸi sÄƒ nu mori. Dar ce poÅ£i sÄƒ faci, cum sÄƒ-Å£i controlezi maÅ£ ele adormite? Ca ÅŸerpii, Ã®n timpul zilei. I-ai vÄƒzut la expoziÅ£ia de reptile, Ã®n acvarii, Ã®ncolÄƒciÅ£i unii peste alÅ£ii. NemiÅŸcaÅ£i, dai bani degeaba pe bilet. Åži te simÅ£i atÃ®t de vinovat, pentru lÄƒcomie ÅŸi pentru nerÄƒbdare, pentru rÄƒutatea ta, care, poftim, s-a adunat acum toatÄƒ Ã®n tine ÅŸi putrezeÅŸte ÅŸi Ã®n curÃ®nd o sÄƒ te otrÄƒveascÄƒ. O femeie Ã®Å£i spune: ridicÄƒ-Å£i picioarele, desfÄƒ-le. ÃŽÅ£i Ã®nfige un furtun Ã®n gaurÄƒ ÅŸi pompeazÄƒ apÄƒ.
