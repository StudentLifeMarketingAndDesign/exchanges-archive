<p>I spent only the first half of my childhood in Romania, and we didn't speak much Romanian at home once we'd moved to the US. My mother wanted desperately for us to learn English, which came easily to a second grader. I took a translation course as an undergrad at Yale, but was translating from French, Henri Michaux, St. John Perse. I was writing poetry (in English) and thought that translating would shock the familiarity out of English, which it did. I found many similarities between translating and writing poems, hungering for precision, scouring one's vocabulary for <em>le mot juste</em> (I can appreciate that the best way to describe the perfect word choice is a French phrase we use deliberately without translating), feeling a vague sense of loss when transcribing from the limitless realm of meaning into the much more restricting realm of expression. <br/><br/>When I moved back to Romania as an adult in 2004, my accent was vaguely Transylvanian, I used outdated words, and I knew nothing about Romanian literature. I had the odd experience that, when I heard it spoken all around me, Romanian was my natural language. But when I spoke it, it was foreign. The opposite felt true for English. I spent two years there trying to merge the familiar and the foreign. Translating Dan Sociu's work feels natural in a sense because I have the feeling that he writes in Romanian the way that I speak in English. We've talked often about this, about his growing up loving America and American movies and, later, American writers. I don't mean to say that there's anything like a one-to-one correspondence between the original and the translated. The language is sometimes deceptively simple and the most important cadences are not easily conveyed in English. But there's a correspondence in the pitch, and this is intensely satisfying to me. I've not had this experience with Romanian writers of older generations.</p>
