<p>This excerpt is from an ongoing double translation of the Aeneid-- first from Latin into a slangy Americanese, and then from the Mediterranean to the North American landmass. Instead of travelling from Troy to Rome by way of Carthage, my Aeneas, pre-nom "The Texan," travels with the remains of the once-proud Troy, TX high school football program (vanquished by their arch-rivals, the Goons) from Troy, TX to California by way of Chicago. Making such a pronounced geographical and cultural translation allowed me to magnify what to me felt like the salient points of Virgil's epic--contemplations of empire and masculinity contrasted with the fact that Aeneas provides a pretty lame center when compared with Achilles or Odysseus. Basically his only virtue is that he's 'pius'; he doesn't seem particularly bright, and a lack of discernment as to the best way to be pius and to whom (his dad, the gods, his wife) leads him to screw up. He screws up a lot, and he whines about it, and other characters call him out on his whining, which is hilarious.Â  Screwing up and then fleeing provides the jerky forward motion of this epic. Meanwhile Juno, 'Boss June' in my book, keeps pouring hot sauce on everything. I realize that this is an anachronistic reading of Aeneas, but my translation is quite dripping with anachronism and juicy with jouissance, while at the same time remaining stubbornly observant of the original sentence structure and syntax. This 'bad fit' of slangy anachronism with a kind of dutiful (â€˜piusâ€™??) school-girl correctness hopefully provides the constitutive tension that keeps the translation attractively false, out of joint, out of tune with itself, yet marching crookedly or sprainedly on. This double approach of homework-i-ness and lucidness also allows me to have it both ways--to engage in Virgil's awesomeness while also showboating with my own language.Â  Another happy accident is that since my version is set on land and Virgil often (virtuosically) uses land imagery to describe the sea scenes, I frequently find myself re-literalizing Virgil's figurative language or even having to invert it again, comparing something happening on land to something involving water, such as a flash flood crushing a big box store and scattering the parked SUV's. Hopefully this has a vertiginous effect. When I first started writing this translation five years ago, the idea of a storm scattering a convoy of trucks in a desert necessarily brought to mind the Iraq War, and I think the 'American'-ness of my tone and diction, as well as the quickly obsolescing youthfulness of the slang, also repeatedly turns the readers' attention to our contemporary global wars, which are rapidly (badly) aging while those who fight them remain so extremely young, some permanently. I hope these subtexts are a constant distraction, at times upending the hierarchies of the text itself.</p>
