<h1 style="text-align: center;">Repetitiveness in Gita Translations</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><br>an essay by <a href="mani-rao/">Mani Rao</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%;">Â </p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">The Bhagavad Gita is a part of the ancient Sanskrit epic <em>Mahabharata</em>, and a Hindu revelatory text. When it was revealed/recorded is anybodyâ€™s guess. Astronomical evidence in the <em>Mahabharata</em> apparently points to circa 3000 BCE, while there is the view that it was written between the 5th andÂ 2nd century BCE. The legend of its authorship is dauntingâ€”the â€œauthorâ€ is Sage Vyasa, but writing the <em>Mahabharata</em> was not a task any mortal could accomplish, however sagacious, so the intelligent god Ganesha must have been the scribe. Ganesha insisted that Vyasa dictate without pause; Vyasa demanded that Ganesha must understand before he transcribed. As if these antecedents are not weighty enough, the 700 stanzas of the Gita are considered a revelation directly from Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu, or God. A heavy tradition. And since the first translation of the Gita into English (1789:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â  </span>Charles Wilkins), hundreds of subsequent translations have created a tradition which every new Gita translator inherits, and attempts to take forward. A highly translated text may, arguably, set a translator free from literalness, and open up the space surrounding the text for new positions and perspectives. However, the status of Gita as holy text acts as a counter-force, steadies and stays the hand of every re-translator. Adherence to and departure from the Gita involve decisions about reverence, ambition, and freedom. In my view, every Gita translation tries to refresh the available material with a slight variation, but it remains too structurally restrained to adequately translate the semantic demands of the original, and too stylistically restrained to convey the delights of Gitaâ€™s language. I demonstrate this with a textual analysis of two verses from well-known translations. But first, I construct what Gideon Toury calls â€œexpectancy norms.â€</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">The Gitaâ€™s opening scene has two armies arrayed in a battlefield, waiting for a signal to begin the war. Warrior Arjuna is immobilized by doubt, so Krishna gives him a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â pep talk. The Gita is more a speech than a dialogue, for Arjunaâ€™s interjections punctuate Krishnaâ€™s orations infrequently. The purpose of Krishnaâ€™s speech is to resolve Arjunaâ€™s moral dilemma; therefore, comprehensibility is vital. Repetitions and switchbacks makeÂ </span>the difficult conceptual terrain negotiable. A metrical composition, each of the stanzas is a couplet and/or a quatrain with 32 syllables; most of the half-lines have 8 syllables. Its meter is called â€œanu<span class="unicode">Å›</span>tubh,â€ a meter most identified with <span style="color: black;">vÄc, or</span> speech.<a name="_ftnref1"></a><span style="mso-special-character: footnote;"><a href="/exchanges-archive/issues/exocity/repetitiveness-in-gita-translations/#_ftn1">[1]</a></span> The meter is blank verse with no end rhymes, and full of internal symmetries: assonances, a lightly alliterative touch and words and constructions that resonate each other. These devices are not convoluted, ornate or display-oriented; they are integral to communication. When the Gita is sung or chanted, it is mostly <strong><span style="font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">to celebrate or memorize or remember the meaning.</span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â </span><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The phonemic value of the Gita is not a thing in itself. The Gita is not a <em>mantra</em> although it may be used as one. </span></strong>It is from these observations that I draw my expectancy norms. First, a translation must follow the rhythm of natural speech. Second, it must be communicative. Third, language must be alive, textured, and encourage the meaning. These expectations form the framework as I compare two verses from a handful of <em>Gita</em> translations:</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">1896. Sir Edwin Arnold. <em>The Song Celestial</em>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">1944. Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood. <em>The Song of God</em>: <em>Bhagavad-Gita.</em></p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">1962. Juan Mascaro. <em>The Bhagavad Gita: Translated from the Sanskrit with an introduction.</em></p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">1972. A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. <em>Bhagawad Gita As It Is.</em></p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">1999. Ashok Kumar Malhotra. Transcreation of the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">2007. Graham M Schweig. <em>Bhagavad Gita: The Beloved Lord's Secret Love Song</em>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Selections range from one of the early translations in 1896 to a recent translation within the last year, from prose to poetry to hybrid, and from translation with no footnotes or commentary, to translation with commentary, transliteration and a dictionary of synonyms. Prabhavananda-Isherwood and Malhotra highlight readability or coherence as a parameter, while Mascaro and Schweig also aim for cadence. Bhaktivedanta provides a lengthy commentary which I do not consider part of the translation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The Gita</span></strong> presents concepts which do not have an exact correspondence in English. These include the incarnation of â€œBrahmanâ€ on earth, the immortality, indestructibility and reincarnation of â€œÄtman,â€ the idea of â€œkarmaâ€ across a continuum of lives and the balanced dyad of love and war. â€œBrahman,â€ often translated in English as â€œGod,â€ is un-personified and neuter gender. Surveying how translators approach â€œÄtmanâ€ helps to reveal the available options and variations. â€œAtmanâ€ is mostly translated as â€œsoulâ€ or â€œself.â€ Most consider â€œsoulâ€ as a more abstract concept, and â€œselfâ€ means different things for different people. Neither word communicates precisely. Sometimes when Krishna says â€œÄtman,â€ he simply means â€œyourselfâ€ or â€œoneself,â€ and sometimes he means more; therefore, settling on either â€œsoulâ€ or â€œselfâ€ creates obscurity. Arnold and Mascaro translate â€œÄtmanâ€ as â€œsoulâ€ regardless of what it refers to in the original. Thus, 6.12 in Arnold and Mascaro is about how to purify the soul, which is contrary to Gitaâ€™s teaching about the soulâ€™s perpetual purity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Bhaktivedanta translates Ätman as â€œself.â€ Prabhavanda-Isherwood retain the Sanskrit terms. Malhotra is wide-ranging; a footnote explains that he will use a range of words â€“ â€œconsciousness,â€ â€œinner self,â€ â€œdivine self,â€ â€œdivine sparkâ€ â€“ depending on the nuance. Schweig translates â€œÄtmanâ€ as â€œ[self]â€ â€“ the parenthesis functions like quotation marks, and indicating that â€œselfâ€ is a placeholder, a term rather than a word. The appendix explains â€œselfâ€ as the best way to encompass all the meanings â€œsoul, body, mind or heart.â€ While Arnold, Schweig and Malhotra refer to Ätman as â€œit,â€ Prabhavananda-Isherwood, Mascaro and Bhaktivedanta personify Ätman with the masculine pronoun â€œheâ€ â€“ gaining a personality but losing a gender. Schweigâ€™s use of the neuter gender matches both source text and contemporary neutral language. On the whole, we are looking at a lack of one-to-one correspondence, often called untranslatability.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">The verses I select for the textual analysis are from Chapter 2, which functions as a summary of the Gita. Translating Chapter 2 involves fundamental conceptual decisions. Krishna begins his teaching with 2.11, and the first three words bring up a tricky questionÂ­â€”how to address Krishna. 2.11 introduces the concept of the soulâ€™s immortality and the transience of life and death. 2.16 introduces the concept of divine reality and truth vs. corporeal unreality and delusion. I take the translation of words from Winthrop Sargeantâ€™s <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>. Before looking at the textual analysis, syntactic differences between English and Sanskrit may be noted. Word order is interchangeable in Sanskritâ€”a shift in the word order during translation would not contribute to loss of meaning.</p>

</blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="color: black;">The Sanskrit repeats the word for â€œmournâ€ in different forms, and pairs the â€œdeadâ€ and the living relative to breath that has gone and not goneâ€”</span>â€œgatÄsÅ«nâ€ and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â  </span>â€œagatÄsÅ«n<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">.â€</span><span style="color: black;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â  </span>The living and the dead are similar, the presence of the prefix â€œaâ€ makes all the difference. The tone is somewhat mocking.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arnold</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Krishna.<br>Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st<br>Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart<br>Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Arnoldâ€™s line has ten syllables, and uses the style of his eraâ€”e.g., â€œmourn notâ€ rather than â€œdo not mourn.â€ He follows the same order of ideas as the original until the first half of the verse, and then needs to flip the order for the second part of the verse. The Sanskrit verse says Arjunaâ€™s words sound wise but really are not, and although mouthing words of wisdom, Arjuna grieves for that which isnâ€™t worth grieving for. Arnold loses the innuendo of the original in his translation. He translates the last word in the verse, â€œpunditah,â€ as one those who are â€œwise in heart,â€ locating wisdom in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prabhavanda/Isherwood</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: .5in;" align="center">SRI KRISHNA</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your words are wise, Arjuna, but your sorrow is for nothing. The truly wise mourn neither for the living nor for the dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Prabhavananda and Isherwood follow the format of a play script, with dialogue, and place the speakerâ€™s name at the center of the line. Arjunaâ€™s name is brought into the first line, emphasizing the address. Punditah has been translated as â€œthe truly wise,â€ this brings out the contrast to Arjuna, who is only apparently wise. The prose has a rhythm to it, and includes the neither-nor pairing of living-dead. Literalisms are avoided, and â€œthose who cannot be lamentedâ€ is summed up as its outcome, â€œfor nothing.â€ In the original, the word for â€œlivingâ€ is the opposite of â€œdead,â€ or â€œgone,â€ and this play is missing in the English translation. Literally, the words mean: â€œthose in whom breath/life has gone,â€ and â€œthose in whom breath/life has not gone.â€ The person is unaffected, immortal; only the breath is gone, or not goneâ€”this comes from the concept of immortality. While Arnold too does not entirely catch the meaning, his translation comes close; â€œliveâ€ and â€œdieâ€ are the actions by those who live and die. By contrast, Prabhavanda/Isherwoodâ€™s nouns â€œlivingâ€ and â€œdeadâ€ have a finality to them which is far from the original.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mascaro</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thy tears are for those beyond tears; and are thy words of wisdom? The wise grieve not for those who live; and they grieve not for those who die â€“ for life and death shall pass away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Todayâ€™s reader-critic is more open to Arnoldâ€™s use of â€œthouâ€ because he is writing in 1896. When Mascaro uses â€œthyâ€ and â€œthou,â€ it comes across as anachronistic. Krishna speaks like an Elizabethan: â€œare thy words of wisdom?â€ Perhaps the language also pitches the relationship between Arjuna and Krishna as loveâ€”God, and devotee, beloved to each other. The conversion of the statement into a questionâ€”â€œare thy words of wisdom?â€ helps capture the mildly chastising tone of the original. Although Mascaro tries to convey the idea that there is no need to feel sorry for â€œthose beyond tearsâ€ because they do not need the tears, the combination of words makes no senseâ€”it is as if the objects of Arjunaâ€™s sympathy have transcended their own tears, rather than them not needing Arjunaâ€™s tears. Mascaro achieves some rhythm by repeating â€œnot for,â€ instead of translating as â€œdo not grieve for,â€ and this double-negative is not in the originalâ€”but it is a shift that helps the meaning. It is towards the end of the verse that Mascaro nails the content, that the person does not â€˜passâ€™, it is life and death that are transient. Mascaroâ€™s translation is quaint and awkward, but conveys the meaning.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bhaktivedanta</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The Blessed Lord said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">â€œBlessedâ€ and â€œLordâ€ resonate with the language of Christianity (and this is also ironic for Bhaktivedantaâ€™s position as the founder of Isckon). â€œNot worthy of griefâ€ overly reduces the status of those who should not be grieved for, it is as if the people who must not be grieved for deserve to be treated indifferently, rather than that the grief itself is irrelevant. Bhaktivedantaâ€™s purport attached to the translation discusses the jibe in Krishnaâ€™s words, but the translation itself does not capture it. â€œWhile speakingâ€ suggests simultaneity, as if Arjuna was half-lamenting and half-speaking; the accurate construction would have been â€œyou speakâ€¦but.â€ The translation does not convey the main idea of the passage of life and death.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malhotra</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2.10)â€¦, Krishna said to him:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2:11) Do you think you are being wise by grieving for those who do not deserve grieving. The wise do not mourn the living or the dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Malhotra takes the address, â€œKrishna saidâ€ into the previous verse 2.10, adds indicators or interjections not in the original. He adds the interrogative to catch the tone of voice of the original, and conveys Krishnaâ€™s mocking tone. Malhotra drops the detail about Arjuna having just spoken profoundly, because it is rather obvious that Arjuna has been speaking, and because the jibe is a response that implies Arjunaâ€™s pomposity/profundity. Malhotra catches the tone but misses the idea of the passage of life and death.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schweig</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Beloved Lord said:<br>You have grieved for that<br>Â Â Â Â Â which is not worthy of grief<br>Â Â Â Â Â and yet you speak words<br>Â Â Â Â Â of profound knowledge.<br>The learned grieve<br>Â Â Â Â Â neither for those<br>Â Â Â Â Â who have passed on,<br>Â Â Â Â Â nor for those<br>Â Â Â Â Â who have not departed.*<br>*<em>Footnote: Krishnaâ€™s teachings commence with this verse.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Schweigâ€™s indentation visually conveys the quatrain structure. But the first stanza is really prose broken up into four parts, while the second stanza makes better use of the poetic line to create a binary rhythm. The beginnings of both stanzas nicely play off of each other: â€œyou have grieved for thatâ€ vs. â€œthe learned grieve.â€ Their contrast is achieved in the inversion that follows immediately, when the word â€œneitherâ€ is in the successive line rather than in the same line as â€œgrieve.â€ The footnote is unnecessary. Schweig addresses Krishna with deference, but adds the idea of love with â€œBeloved,â€ which brings in the presence of the devotee-author-translator. The translation focuses attention on the idea of â€œgoneâ€ or â€œpassed on.â€ Schweig translates â€œanvaÅ›ocasâ€<em> </em>into past tense, which follows the original but is unnecessary detail, adding nothing to the sense, and taking away from the possibility of â€œyou grieve for that.â€ Schweig could quite easily have dropped the word â€œdepartedâ€ in the second stanza as it would have been implied, but he does not do that, it is obvious he is being faithful to the letter. He pays attention to the word â€œprajnyaâ€ (knowledge), but ends up with a clumsy construction in English, â€œwords of profound knowledge.â€ Schweig captures the invariant core of the Gita verse, but does not succeed in natural speech rhythms.</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of comparison 2.11</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">If the passage of life and death is considered the invariant core of the meaning, Arnold, Malhotra, Prabhavanda/Isherwood and Bhaktivedanta miss it, Schweig and Mascaro catch it. All translators interpret â€œpunditahâ€ (priest, scholar) as â€œwise,â€ Schweig integrates knowledge into the idea with â€œlearned.â€ Arnoldâ€™s translation reads like spoken verse and his shifts do not result in misrepresentation, Malhotraâ€™s is the least literal and the most natural but not striking, Prabhavandaâ€™s is natural, Bhaktivedantaâ€™s is unweildy and uncompensated by accuracy, Mascaroâ€™s translation is a little quaint, Schweigâ€™s is more clear but restrained by fidelity to the letter and structure for structureâ€™s sake. Nobody comes close to showing the living and the dead as a closely related set.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bhagavad Gita 2.16</span></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>naâ€”not; asatahâ€”of the nonexistent/of the nonreal; vidyateâ€”it is found; bhÄvasâ€”being, coming to be, becoming. naâ€”not; abhÄvahâ€”not being, not existing, not becoming; vidyateâ€”it is found; satahâ€”of the real/true/existent;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Â  </span>ubhayohâ€”of both; apiâ€”indeed, surely, also, even; d<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">á¹›á¹£á¹­</span>ahâ€”seen, perceived, discerned; antahâ€”certainty, conclusion, end; tuâ€”indeed, but; anayoh--of these two; tattvaâ€”truth, reality, thatness; darÅ›ibhi<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">á¸¥</span>â€”by the seers/perceivers/discerners/knowers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">The symmetry of this verse cannot be missed. The sound pairs of â€œnÄsatoâ€ â€œsata<span style="font-family: Tahoma;">á¸¥â€ </span>and â€œbhÄvoâ€ â€œnÄbhÄvoâ€ are not just the rhythm, but the message that contrasts truth with delusion. The first part of the verse is complexâ€”what â€œisâ€ and what â€œis notâ€ could refer to anythingâ€”living/non-living, animate/inanimate, fact/lie. From the materialist perspective, the physical world â€œisâ€ and the â€œspiritualâ€ world is conjecture, and the translation could be understood as a confirmation of materialism. Besides, it seems unsurprising for that which is non-existent to be non-existent. To convey this message adequately in English, one has to turn to etymologyâ€”â€œtruthâ€ in Sanskrit is derived from the verb â€œto be.â€</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arnold</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Lives in the life undying!) That which is<br>Can never cease to be; that which is not<br>Will not exist. To see this truth of both<br>Is theirs who part essence from accident,<br>Substance from shadow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Arnold translates lines 1 and 2 to the letter, except for inverting the order. Lines 3 and 4 are unintelligible. Perhaps Arnold means: â€œto see the truth of both is <em>their role</em>, who part essence fromâ€¦â€ Arnold also revises the message, introducing â€œsubstanceâ€ and â€œshadow,â€ and â€œaccidentâ€ is incomprehensible. Arnoldâ€™s seer separates substance from shadow, whereas in the original no such distinction is made, the seer sees the truth of both.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prabhavananda/Isherwood</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That which is non-existent can never come into being, and that which is can never cease to be. Those who have known the inmost Reality know also the nature of is and is not.</p>

<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Prabhavananda and Isherwood translate â€œasatahâ€ and â€œsatahâ€ as non-existent and â€œthat which isâ€ â€“ which does not help communicate. The translation of â€œtattvaâ€ into â€œinmost Realityâ€ is acceptable although incomprehensible to the general reader. The capital R reality suggests a different reality, <em>the </em>reality. Lines 3 and 4 of the original do not say much, except that seers can tell the difference. â€œDarÅ›itahâ€ is a noun, and has no tense, but the present tense would be most apt; the change from those who know to those who â€œhave knownâ€ refers to a past accomplishment which may no longer be applicable.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mascaro</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unreal never is: the Real never is not. This truth indeed has been seen by those who can see the true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Mascaro follows the negatives in the original, and succumbs to the esoteric capital R real to communicate an other reality. The insertion of â€œindeedâ€ follows the Sanskrit to the letter. Sanskrit uses emphatic interjections such as â€œindeed,â€ abundantly, they act primarily as fillers. When carried over into the English, â€œindeedâ€ seems stilted. The second line is obscureâ€”what else would those who see the true see, but the truth? And what is the difference between â€œtruthâ€ and â€œthe true,â€ except that the latter is grand?</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bhaktivedanta</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent there is no endurance, and of the existent there is no cessation. This seers have concluded by studying the nature of both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Bhaktivedantaâ€™s elaboration on the process undergone by seers gives an impression of a group of seers examining the real and coming up with a collective â€˜conclusion.â€™ It also seems as though there are two kinds of seers â€“ seers of untruth, and seers of truth. Bhaktivedanta presents the message as the conclusion of seers, rather than the gift of divine vision. The nouns â€œcessationâ€ and â€œenduranceâ€ are difficult to understandâ€”Bhaktivedanta has this construction because he begins the line with â€œof the.â€</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malhotra</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nonexistent never comes into being and the existent does not ever cease to be. The sages who clearly distinguish this fact are the discerners of truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Malhotraâ€™s translation is close to Prabhavandaâ€™s and Isherwoodâ€™s, using the same inversion of order, and dipping into the common stock of words most translators useâ€”â€œexistentâ€ and â€œnonexistentâ€â€”blurry words. Malhotra expands on the less important part of the verse, the part about the seers, calls them â€œsages,â€ locates them in the past and alienates his readers by placing the possibility of truth and knowledge far out of their reach.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schweig</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the impermanent<br>Â Â  Â  one finds no being;<br>Â Â Â Â Â one finds no nonbeing<br>Â Â Â Â Â of the permanent.<br>Indeed, the certainty<br>Â Â Â Â Â of both of these<br>Â Â Â Â Â has been perceived<br>Â Â Â Â Â by seers of the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Schweig does a refreshing translation with â€œimpermanentâ€ and â€œpermanent,â€ much more communicative than â€œrealâ€ or â€œexisting.â€ Schweig has structural restraints, and the insubstantial lines 3 and 4 expand into the superfluous â€œcertainty of both of these,â€ when all that needs to be said is seers know this to be true. Schweig positions the seersâ€™ perception in the past tense, implies there may be two kinds of seers, and includes â€œindeed.â€</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of comparison 2.16:</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Mascaroâ€™s translation is the most poetic, but as incomprehensible as the rest of the translators except for Schweig. Schweigâ€™s translation communicates, but is structurally constrained.</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">Arnold writes metrical poetry, and Schweigâ€™s text looks like poetry. The lack of meter would put Schweigâ€™s text in the category of â€œfree verse,â€ but there are no poetic aspects of sound/rhythm/resonance or space. In Sanskrit, compounding words can help fit the line into the beat; attempting to follow a structure in English results in either obscure density or looseness. Arnold and Schweig are constrained by their structures. Mascaroâ€™s text is poetic but quaint and obscure. Malhotra communicates but is prosaic. Prabhavanda and Isherwood use a natural speech, but with the standard obscurities. Bhaktivedantaâ€™s translation is obscure and works only when assisted by lengthy commentary, which raises questions about the place of translations within the activity of disseminating the Gita message. All translate stanza by stanza, do not tap the meaningful language-play of the original, and do not harness the potentialities of sound/resonance and space of the language translated into.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%;">What distinguishes one translation from another, then, is the lineage of the translator, the credentials of the Sanskritist or religious leader, and the packaging for which the title is one clue. Arnold has the time and place of a Western initiate into Eastern mysteriesâ€”â€œBhagavadâ€ (literally, Godâ€™s) becomes â€œcelestial,â€ which contrasts with the Hindu idea of Krishna as the earthly incarnation of Vishnu. Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwoodâ€™s title, <em>â€œThe Song of God: Bhagavad-Gita,â€ </em>is literal, but changes the Sanskrit structure of â€œGodâ€™s Songâ€ into the more flowing structure of â€œThe Song of God,â€ reminiscent of â€œSong of Songs.â€ The use of the double title echoes the collaboration, each translator as cultural representative. Mascaroâ€™s title, <em>â€œThe Bhagavad Gita: Translated from the Sanskrit with an introduction,â€</em> indicates that this book provides â€œmoreâ€ than a translation. Bhativedantaâ€™s title, <em>â€œBhagawad Gita As It Is,â€ </em>repositions other translations as distortions, and sets itself up as authentic. Malhotraâ€™s <em>â€œTranscreation of the Bhagavad Gitaâ€</em> could reflect that Malhotra defines translation as an endeavor in literalness. Schweigâ€™s title <em>â€œBhagavad Gita: The Beloved Lord's Secret Love Songâ€</em> has a devotional tone. The word â€œsecretâ€ in the title emphasizes the point that this text comes directly from â€œThe Beloved Lord,â€ and that the book is an intimate record; this detail generates both trust (because the translator has received secret communication from Krishna), and mistrust (because he calls a secret what has been common knowledge for centuries). The â€œlookâ€ of each book is different too. Malhotraâ€™s looks like a study guide, which was its intention. Schweigâ€™s comes with an extensive translatorâ€™s note, thus targeting a more sophisticated reader. Bhaktivedantaâ€™s book is part of Isckonâ€™s religious program. At the textual level, however, the differences are not marked. Understanding the Gita continues to involve a translation as well as a commentary for help with the more difficult parts. All translations focus on translating the meaning, not the poem, so the only way for a reader to appreciate Gitaâ€™s poetry is to study Sanskrit.</p>
