Carmelo Bene</h1>
<p>Carmelo Bene was born in Campi Saletina, Italy in 1937. He began his career as a stage actor, and soon formed his own theater company; his adaptation of Camusâ€™s Caligula put him in the avant-garde limelight as early as 1959. Bene directed and took on leading roles in his own performance pieces, from which he developed a theory of theater inspired by Antonin Artaud. Beneâ€™s work opposes classical text-based theater, and his theories generally revolve around the necessity of recreating texts in performance with the actor-as-subject or actorial machine. He considered his work to be about a â€œconstant becomingâ€ in a perpetual state of incompletion. Bene believed that to merely repeat the written lines of famous playwrights was to murder theater. His art, therefore, is an art of repetition through extreme variation. By experimenting with classical dramatic texts, Bene became known as a notorious destroyer of texts. Outside the theater, he was a prolific writer, critic, radio performer, television actor, and filmmaker. In 1968, his controversial <em>Nostra Signora dei Turchi</em> (<em>Our Lady of the Turks</em>), which he adapted from his own 1965 novel of the same title, brought him acclaim as an avant-garde filmmaker. Bene interacted and collaborated with some of the most perceptive minds of the latter half of the twentieth century, such as Gilles Deleuze and Pier Paolo Pasolini, and found inspiration in contemporary thinkers such as Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, and Jacques Lacan, who largely influenced his critical and creative work. Many of his works, including his complete theatrical works, have been translated into French by Jean-Paul Manganaro. Bene died in Rome in 2002.</p>
