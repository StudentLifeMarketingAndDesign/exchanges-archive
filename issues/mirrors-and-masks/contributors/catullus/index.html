<h1>Catullus</h1>
<p>Catullus was born in 84 B.C. in Verona, is said to have moved to Rome around 62 B.C. and probably died around 54 B.C. The manuscript that I translated, known simply as <em>The Complete Poems of Gaius Valerius Catullus</em>, was rediscovered in Catullusâ€™ hometown around the 14th century. There is even a myth that the manuscript was found in an empty wine caskâ€”after centuries of soaking up the spirits. Regardless, in just three decades, Catullus managed to fondle Venus, lick the sweat off the upper lip of Bacchus, and give birth to a blues lyric that has battled time.â€¨â€¨Catullus was a young, brash, salacious, and semi-famous celebrity at a time when most poetry was probably performed. Think Shelley mixed with Lou Reed and then some Lilâ€™ Wayne (at his most vulgar moments)â€”his poems are political and mythological and sometimes absurd. In a great little prefatory description to his own translation, Jacob Rabinowitz asks us to imagine Catullus as a â€œplayboy in the midst of a collapsing republicâ€”roughly the Roman equivalent of a rock star. He could terrify a general or win a woman (or boy) just by inviting him to be the hero of a poem. Caesar begged for his friendship, and, whatâ€™s even more remarkable, Cicero shut up when he spoke.â€ Catullus wrote many â€œlove poems,â€ and he wrote many â€œhate poems.â€ He wrote mythology. He translated Greek poets like Sappho and Callimachus. He wrote a short, absurd play with two characters, one of which is the front door to a house, who tells us thatÂ one member of a famous political family knocked up his sonâ€™s wife because his son was impotent. He wrote heart-wrenching poems about his brotherâ€™s death and for people that have died at war. He belittled men (mostly ex-friends and politicians) for the small size of theirâ€”well, manhood.Â Some of hisÂ poems areÂ about waking up with prostitutes and many more about his tumultuous relationship with his lover, or his primary lover, whom he names Lesbia, but whoÂ is known to be the historical figure Clodia,Â the wife of a conservative RomanÂ consul.</p>
