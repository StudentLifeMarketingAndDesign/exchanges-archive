<h1>I Am Non-Existent: Therefore I Am</h1>
<h2><a href="carole-viers/">Carole Viers</a></h2>
<div style="margin-left: auto; width: 70%; margin-right: 0pt;"><br/>Alles ist innig<br/>Das scheidet<br/>So birgt der Dichter.<br/>Verwegener! mÃ¶chtest von Angesicht<br/>zu Angesicht<br/>Die Seele sehn.<br/>Du gehest in Flammern unter.<br/><div style="text-align:right;">HÃ¶lderlin</div>
</div>
<p>I am non-existent: therefore I am. Elsewhere. Here.<br/>Where? a dream appeared before my eyes<br/>of She who never was<br/>The one who never lived and never died.</p>
<div style="font-size:.8em;">This disquiet of the non-dead<br/>What tells me to rise a somnambulist <br/>from my half-closed coffin-bed?<br/>I rise inside my room, unlimited by human borders.<br/>I am at times my self-same black attire for formal occasions<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒeach time definitive.<br/>What reawakens me from my premature, aristocratic<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒinterment?<br/>The doctrine of the definitive dead commands me to my<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒusual practices<br/>that, now alone, release me from<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒhuman will,<br/>from the vain logic of those amorous occasions<br/>of the world as representation.<br/>Why non-dead? Why not yet?<br/>What in the world tickles my indifference?<br/>Which voices (of women?) weave the wind encompassing<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒthe castle-image<br/>of my nearly absolute aesthetic derision?<br/>Who conceives me? What in the world worries the non-dead?</div>
<p><br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒAnd the non-dead is, in fact, prostrate at the foot of an immense, empty frame. This immense frame does not capture the image of She who never was.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒAnd it does not even serve as a mirror for the vampire, since vampires cast no reflection.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒAnd here, in what appears as almost a confession:<br/>â€ƒ â€ƒâ€ƒif the non-dead were not conceived, evoked in the narcissistic unconscious of his â€œvictimsâ€ who then, â€œmade vampires,â€ hastily withdraw their fright, he would not even dream of leaving his most sought out funereal bed (taking for granted his unfulfilled prayer of never waking), just as a dandy would never pose were he not looked upon.</p>
<div style="margin-left: auto; width: 70%; margin-right: auto;"><br/><span style="font-size:.8em;">Being dead is hard work.</span><br/><div style="text-align:right;">R.M. Rilke</div>
<br/></div>
<p>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒTherefore, every night, every moment night falls, having attended to his own devotions to his huge, empty frame, having thoroughly extinguished one by one the candles of his â€œneed to beâ€â€”but not so thoroughly after allâ€”the vampire forces himself to go to sleep in his coffin-bed. And here lies his anxiety of the non-dead. His <em>non</em>. <br/><br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒHe is nevertheless attracted by the â€œaleatory,â€ by the â€œextension of life.â€<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒHere the drawing room, the flirtations, the conventional.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒHere his masochistic readiness toward the arrogant narcissism of his victims.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒHere our non-dead preens, dressing himself in front of the absent mirror.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒYes, the absence of She who never was, this womanly cocoon is intolerable day in and day out.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒSo therefore, away!, from one altar to another!</p>
<div style="margin-left: auto; width: 70%; margin-right: auto;"><br/><span style="font-size:.8em;">Life, the ancient fortune-teller, secretly<br/>whispers forgotten words to meâ€¦</span> <br/><div style="text-align:right;">A. Blok</div>
</div>
<p>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒThe only thing that remains for the non-dead is to â€œconcentrateâ€ on the dressing table, an end unto itself: a button in the wrong buttonhole (the vampire has no reflection, he dresses like a blind man) it determines, it compromises speech. Aphasia of language. (<em>Nude</em>, he expresses nothing, he produces no sound, neither on the stage nor in the orchestra for, in deed, on undressed occasions, he is paralyzed, he falls silent)â€¦<br/><br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒAphasia of language occurs like clockwork between the acts, between garments, in omission, in certain clumsy clothing combinations, clashes, etc.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒIn such cases, stammers, inhuman spasms, grunts, excesses of convulsive coughs, cold and hot sweat, senseless naming dominate the scene. <br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒThe <em>Vampire-Actor</em> is paradoxically the <em>Feminine</em> elevated to <em>Consciousness</em>.<br/><br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€œShe did appear to me, all love.â€ She appeared. <br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒThe little theater of the fractured-I, and the subject falls in love with playing.<br/>â€ƒ â€ƒâ€ƒBut stage dressing is like the stage itself, a parody of an image that negates itself (it negates itself from the beginning). In the derisory laugh of the same infinitely profferable gestures, the Actorâ€™s damned practice has as its sole purpose to draw from the mind every other thing possible, everything but that unique, non-existent thing, which only an oral writing can open up to the void.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒAs for the suspension of the love that threatens figures:</p>
<div style="margin-left: auto; width: 70%; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><br/><span style="font-size:.8em;">â€¦Do not appear before me, O Unheeded one.<br/>It is not She. She does not exist. She is from elsewhere,<br/>Unfaithful even to herself,<br/>Like the tranquility of the dead once and for all.<br/>You are missing.<br/>I hear in your voice how tired you are.<br/>Oh rest, oh rest. You must die<br/>From time to timeâ€¦<br/></span></div>
<p><br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒFrom time to time. â€œTimeâ€ is the duration of the spectacle. And the spectacleâ€™s task is to not take place.</p>
<div style="margin-left: auto; width: 70%; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-size:.8em;">And my weak spirit fails<br/>To think how the dead must freeze <br/>Beneath the churchyard mould.</span><br/><div style="text-align:right;">R. Kipling</div>
<br/></div>
<p>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒThe poor dead who are cold beneath the churchyard mould, who suffocateâ€”precipitous burialsâ€”under the weight of the earth, who flounder unheard in their coffinsâ€¦ It is <em>impunity, the recurrent immaturity of the dead.</em><br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒThis and only this can produce emotive poetry.</p>
<div style="margin-left: auto; width: 70%; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-size:.8em;">All the rest is theater.</span></div>
<p><br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒThe starts of the â€œwretched deadâ€ are interferences in the suspension of the Tragic: they are the â€œheroicâ€ starts of the conventional tragic-I that the child subject empowers to mock them. It is the representative identity that clumsily peers into the empty desert, where he wills and unwills the very will and not this or that specific object; he desires his own sorrow.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒIn the poverty of representation, more or less great â€œactorsâ€ alternate, imitating, without ever succeeding, the arrogant, improvised ego-deprived spectators, encouraged by the spectacle of the ministers to the senseless, mundane representation of the state.<br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒIn the theater of the non-representable, <em>the Actor is infinite</em>. He is the infinite of the para-statal disregard.</p>
<div style="margin-left: auto; width: 70%; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-size:.8em;">He is the infinite that constitutes the loss of himself.</span></div>
<p><br/>â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒLoss is not a temporary shutting down of being. Existence itself is a shutting down. <br/>â€ƒ â€ƒâ€ƒThe subject-Actor is such insofar as he is not an actor. While the ever more powerful super-ego is watchful, the performer-I refuses his own role right before the spectacle begins. Sometimes (always) you feel the performer-I act on whims, interfering at times in the Actorâ€™s non-being; but this inconvenience had been prevented in a kind of masochistic, contractual stipulation, and the <em>impasse</em>, the embarrassment, the uneaseâ€”this sacred and at the same time liturgical incompatibilityâ€”is humor: to pray in a brothel or curse in church. And this is, after all, the only â€œadversarial natureâ€ acceptable in theater. Because it is <em>the</em> theater.</p>
