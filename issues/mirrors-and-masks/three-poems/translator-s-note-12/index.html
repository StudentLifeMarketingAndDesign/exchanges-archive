<p><strong>Notes on Translating Poems 65, 66, 68</strong><br/><br/>While translating Catullus, a project that lasted (on and off) for four years, I was concerned with presenting an accurate translationâ€”one that is as â€œliteralâ€ as possible, yet allowing for the music and beauty and slang and salaciousness and complexity of the original language to be transferred into contemporary American English. A concern for only â€œliteralâ€ accuracy in literary translation would result in books of poems that conveyed little of the tumbling quickness of Catullusâ€™ lines (and mind), let alone the cynical eye he turns toward violent ambition. A concern for this kind of accuracy can be important when reading, and especially when learning to read Latin, but I have tried to avoid it in these translations.<br/><br/>Catullusâ€™ longer â€œMythological Poemsâ€ (poems 61-68) often deal with themes of war and destruction as well as love and jealousy. The imagery of these longer poems is rich, steeped in mythology, and the poems can be syntactically complicated. Catullus also weaves together allusion with personal anecdote, different styles of writing and tense shifts, and repeats phrases from his manuscript (which appear in entirely different contexts). For all their complexity, however, these poems run beautifully along like well-crafted and intricate musicâ€”they can feel spontaneously emotional yet deeply orchestrated. To say that this presents wonderful challenges for someone writing in contemporary American English is a bit of an understatement.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Poem 65</strong><br/><strong>The â€œGolden Appleâ€; the language of politics and gender:</strong><br/><br/>Poem 64 is a 408-line poem that traces a time â€œwhen heroes bred with godsâ€ (line 23) until humans are overcome by the pollution of war and destruction. For Catullus, this â€œfallâ€ (not in the Christian sense of the word) stems from the same jealous angst that results from infidelity. Poem 65 is a mere 24 lines, making it the only short poem of this middle section. This is also the first poem in the manuscript where Catullus directly refers to the loss of his brother, which he begins in his typical style of writing a letter.<br/><br/>When Catullus finishes the last ten lines of this poem, he returns to the songs of Battiades, better known to us as Callimachus; he does this as well in the last poem of the manuscript (Poem 116). It is my assumption that the last six lines are to be read as a translation into Latin of Callimachusâ€™ Greek. Though there is no way to prove this, and though I have yet to come across research that suggests this, Catullus does seem to offer an introduction to verse not his own, before the voice of the speaker shifts dramatically and describes a far different scene in which a wife learns of the death of her husband.<br/><br/><em>And though Iâ€™m still in great torment, Hortalus, I hurl<br/>these lyrics of Battiades right at you.<br/>Your faithful words, exhaled into the vague wind,<br/>truly cleanse my soul. But itâ€™s in vain.<br/>As she lets the apple that her new husband gave her<br/>fall off her lap when her mother<br/>arrives, from under her soft slip,<br/>she falls forward miserably,<br/>bent over the ground and heaving<br/>as she learns of this sadness, her face turns red.<br/></em><br/>The wife at the end of Poem 65 seems to hold the apple as some sort of sentimental gift or relic of her husbandâ€™s love. As a symbol, the relic could show the immortality of love, which makes the scene of this wife overcome with the emotion of losing her husband so touching and timeless. The apple appears in other parts of the manuscript in a much more sexual way, which also fits the immortality that lovers can achieve through procreation. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Poem 66: </strong><br/><strong>The â€œmythologyâ€ of feeling â€œfucked overâ€:</strong><br/><br/>Even though fidelity seems to be something Catullus lacked in his life, he yearned for it intensely and felt miserably cheated when his lovers left him. In this poem Catullus obsesses, with many mythological references, over the greed of global expansion (promoted by war) and morally equates it with infidelity. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Poem 68</strong><br/><strong>Dear Manlius, my brother is dead:</strong><br/><br/>The poem in the form of â€œthe letterâ€ may find its father in Catullus. Though poets have had their speakers address specific people throughout the history of lyric poetry, no one poet had so consistently and effectively adopted this as a style before Catullus, and certainly no other poet addressed the process of writing the letter in the body of the poem so specifically.<br/><br/>Poem 68 begins as a letter to Manlius, Catullusâ€™ friend back in Rome, while Catullus was in Verona for the funeral of his brother. Catullus laments the misery he feels for the loss of his brother. Because of the mythology that Catullus includes later on in this poem, we are left to assume that his brother died at war, or at least for the expansion of the Roman Empire, a sin which we know is equally disappointing to Catullus. In any case, in lines 89 through 99, by alluding to the myth of the Trojan War, where King Menelaus is left by Helen (or, depending on the myth, she is taken from him against her will), Catullus once again questions why so many humans have died because of phallic posturing. Catullus blames his brotherâ€™s death, or anyoneâ€™s death for that matter that is the result of war, on feelings of jealousy and the privilege to act on it by powerful people.<br/><br/>â€” <a href="ryan-gallagher/">Ryan Gallagher</a></p>
