<p>A prospector sifts through a river to collect shining flakes.<br/>An archeologist brushes away dust to reveal an artifact.<br/>A chemist distills or, better yet, centrifuges a component into an essence.<br/>A tea drinker releases the flavor of the leaves into the water.<br/><br/>Tarek Eltayeb brought his hands forward, again and again, his fingers pursed then opening, as he gave these examples. There is a word in Arabic, he said, that can carry all of these actions. The dictionaryâ€™s translation, <em>to free</em>, was not quite right. <br/><br/>Later I noticed that he used the same gestureâ€”hands forward and opening rhythmicallyâ€”in describing how he writes. To collect, to care for, to distill, to release: these were his hopes for his poems and stories. He wanted to free them.<br/><br/>He had freed them all in Arabic. Many of them had been freed in German and other languages. Our project was to free some of his poems in English. In total we translated ten previously published poems and one essay. <br/><br/>He would choose a poem and dictate a rough translation into English. I would step from word to word and explain the possibilities that the word threw off. Mr. Eltayeb would squint, smile and ask me, â€œWhich do you like?â€ By the end of the session, each poem would be a forest of alternatives, ink-branches ending in word-leafs, some highlighted for further inspection. By our next meeting, I would have pruned them down to a recognizable shape and we would go through them again. He would look into a bare spot on the table, look up, and say which option he preferred. <br/><br/>Throughout this revolving process, I felt closer to the images, sounds, emotions, and narratives that formed the poems. Tarek Eltayebâ€™s ideas would drift through my head. In the case of â€œHostage,â€ they dug. The care, intelligence, and strangeness of the poems set my pace as I biked around town, washed dishes and wandered in the grocery aisle. Tarek Eltayebâ€™s poems refreshed the words that came under my eyes and out of my pen. His work helped me free my own ideas.<br/><br/>â€” <a href="thomas-fox-parry/">Thomas Fox Parry</a></p>
